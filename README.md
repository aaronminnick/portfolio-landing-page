## Portfolio Landing Page 
#### _by Aaron Minnick_
### Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS (including Bootstrap)

This is a portfolio landing page to showcase my work learning to program at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com). The page will be updated over time to show off the best projects I produce during the program. To access the page, click [HERE](https://aaronminnick.github.io/portfolio-landing-page/). Or, follow the setup instructions below to launch the page from a local copy on your machine.

### Setup Instructions:
_(Please note, the below instructions are using gitbash on a Windows computer. Commands may vary if you are using a different OS or terminal program.)_
* Initialize a local repository in your desired location using the terminal:
```
$ git init
```
* Clone this repository to your local repository (the link may be easily got using the green "Code" button on the github page):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/aaronminnick/portfolio-landing-page
```
* Open index.html with your default browser:
```

**Or** you may use the green "Code" button to download the files to your computer. Then simply extract the package, and open index.html with your browser of choice.
