## Portfolio Landing Page 
#### _by Aaron Minnick_
### Technologies Used:

This is a portfolio landing page to showcase my work learning to program at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com). The page will be updated over time to show off the best projects I produce during the program. To access the page, click [HERE](https://www.aaronminnick.github.io/portfolio_landing_page). Or, follow the setup instructions below to launch the page from a local copy on your machine.

### Setup Instructions:
